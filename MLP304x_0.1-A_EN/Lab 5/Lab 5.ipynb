We can also model this data with a mixture of Gaussians, though with increasing dimension we run into two important issues associated with using a full covariance matrix for each component.\n"," * Computational cost becomes prohibitive in high dimensions: score calculations have complexity cubic in the number of dimensions M if the Gaussian has a full covariance matrix.\n"," * A model with many parameters require more data: observe that a full covariance matrix for an M-dimensional Gaussian will have M(M+1)/2 parameters to fit. With the number of parameters growing roughly as the square of the dimension, it may quickly become impossible to find a sufficient amount of data to make good inferences.\n","\n","Both of these issues are avoided if we require the covariance matrix of each component to be diagonal, as then it has only M parameters to fit and the score computation decomposes into M univariate score calculations.

Random initialization may sometimes produce a superior fit than k-means initialization.

This was made possible by modifying the model to assume a diagonal covariance for each cluster, and by modifying the implementation to use a sparse matrix representation. In the second part you explored the role of k-means initialization on the convergence of the model as well as the interpretability of the clusters."]}]}
